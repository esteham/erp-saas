              Founded in 2010 by John Smith, a master technician with 20 years of experience, 
              our company started as a small local operation with just two employees. 
              Today, we've grown to a team of 25 dedicated professionals serving the entire region.
            </p>
            <p>
              What hasn't changed is our commitment to treating every customer like family 
              and every job like it's our own home. We take pride in our work and believe 
              in doing things right the first time.
